      <description>In this project, my goal was to explore a clinical dataset to create a machine learning model that can predict patient heart failure survival. By exploring the data, the aim will be to select the most important features that can be used for a machine learning algorithm. Different machine learning algorithms will be created in order to evaluate the best performing model.

      <title>Project 1: Retail Price Optimization</title>

      <description>For this project my goal was to explore a dataset containing information on retail pricing in order to identify a method to optimize a balance of retail pricing and customer attraction.
Data was explored by analyzing relationships and creating visualizations to easily identify trends. I looked into the retail categories to compare them to each other as well as to other retail competitors. I used a Decision Tree regression model to make pricing predictions and to compare to actual pricing.</description>
