      <description>In this project, my goal was to explore a clinical dataset to create a machine learning model that can predict patient heart failure survival. By exploring the data, the aim will be to select the most important features that can be used for a machine learning algorithm. Different machine learning algorithms will be created in order to evaluate the best performing model.

      <description>For this project my goal was to explore a dataset containing information on retail pricing in order to identify a method to optimize a balance of retail pricing and customer attraction.
Data was explored by analyzing relationships and creating visualizations to easily identify trends. I looked into the retail categories to compare them to each other as well as to other retail competitors. I used a Decision Tree regression model to make pricing predictions and to compare to actual pricing.</description>

      <description>I graduated from UCSD in 2020 with a bachelor&amp;rsquo;s in Human Biology. Ever since then, I journeyed into the biotech industry where I continue to find myself in at the current moment. I&amp;rsquo;ve had the opportunity to work at great companies and expand my skills with each job. I&amp;rsquo;ve specifically worked in clinical lab technician, quality control, and research associate roles. Throughout all these roles, I&amp;rsquo;ve realized the tremendous value of data and its role in shaping the gene therapy, pharmaceutical, and biotech industry in general.</description>
